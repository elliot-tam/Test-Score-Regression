# Test-Score-Regression

## Description
This project aims to answer the question: 
> "Can we use student demographics and neighborhood characteristics to predict academic success for a school in a given zip code?"

This model aims to provide the following insights

    - Inform district leaders how to better support specific school sites 
    - Provide insight into where to build a new school
    - Shed light to a larger system at play in the way success is defined that determine how resources and funds are allocated
    
In our model, Academic Success is defined as English Language Arts/Literacy (CAASPP) Scores for high schools in California. This model can easily be replicated for
other test groups and scores for the CAASPP. 

Data was primarily collected from the California Department of Education website

## File Explanations

1. CA Public School Success: This jupyter notebook contains all code for this project [this was my first individual data science project, please be understanding!]
My process as can be seen in the code was collecting data(combining files & webscraping) > cleaning data > EDA > modeling > feature selection > model tuning
2. Project 2 Presentation: The powerpoint I created for this project can be found here with slides and visualizations describing the tools I used, my process, and findings
3. misc: The raw data files I found online or scraped, dataframes I pickled in my code, and additional visuals can be found in their labeled folders.
